## PROFESSIONAL GOALS ‚Äì ‚ÄúMake Data confess‚Äù

Data Scientist and AI consultant. Data analytics, data-driven and AI-based Solutions for engineering and industrial problems. PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence with 18+ years of experience in research and education (undergraduate and postgraduate levels).

Since 2018 working (designing, developing and providing business value) in a focussed and organised manner towards delivering Business-Driven AI-based solutions in Airline and Engineering (Transportation, Defence and Air Traffic Management) companies. Projects for Data Exploitation (Forecasting, Predictive Maintenance), Face Recognition, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Optimization. Trying to adopt Methodologies (CRISP-DM, TDSP and CPMAI) to provide the foundation needed for AI project success. Project planning and Team coordination, also with both stake holders and other teams related to Data Engineering and Business Intelligence, working with external providers. Also, supervising, leading, AI and Data Science teams (+6 people), and work close to AI unit manager.   

Associate Professor (Interim) at UC3M; 50+ international publications, work on 8 research projects, most of them for advanced driver assistance systems (traffic sing recognition, driver monitoring); 2 PhD Thesis as advisor; organisation of 6 development cooperation projects (founding, development, and strengthening of the Research and Technological Development Unit at UNAN-Managua, Nicaragua). 

Since 2012, Positive assessment as Associate Professor (Profesor Titular) by ANECA

18 years of research in machine learning (artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, ensembles), applied to classification (traffic sign recognition), regression, and time series forecasting. 18 years of teaching in computer science on different subjects: programming, theory of automata and formal languages, compilers, and computational complexity.
